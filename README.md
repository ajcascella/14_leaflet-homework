## Background

In this project I used data from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) to build a new set of tools that visualizes earthquake data with the hope to better educate the public and other government organizations on issues facing our planet.

## Step by Step

* Accessed JSON representation of earthquake data and used this url for the data for the visualizations.

* Created a map using Leaflet that plots all of the earthquakes from data set based on their longitude and latitude.

   * Data markers reflect the magnitude of the earthquake in their size and color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes appear larger and darker in color.

   * Included popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when a marker is clicked.

   * Created a legend that will provide context for map data.
